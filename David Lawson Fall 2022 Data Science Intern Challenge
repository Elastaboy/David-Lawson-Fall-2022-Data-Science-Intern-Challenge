Question 1

1.The $3145.13 AOV was most likely calculated incorrectly using the count() function instead of sum() to calculate the total items (). Although count() just returns the total number of rows, sum() returns the AOV value by adding all of the entries in the total items column.

2.The reporting metrics for determining the right Average Order Value (AOV) are the sums of both 'order amount' and 'total items':
	
	Order_amount sum= 15725640 or ( sum=(D:D)
	Total_items sum= 43936 or (sum=E:E)

	Then, divide the Order_amount sum to the Total_items sum.

3.When you do this, the average order value is:$357.92

Question 2

1.54 orders were shipped by Speedy Express.

	SELECT ShipperName, COUNT() FROM Orders JOIN Shippers on Orders.ShipperID =                                      Shippers.ShipperID WHERE ShipperName="Speedy Express"

2.The last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock.

SELECT LastName, COUNT() as TotalOrders FROM Orders INNER JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC LIMIT 1;

3.Boston Crab Meat was the order that was mostly ordered by customers in Germany.

SELECT Products.ProductName, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalOrders FROM Orders
JOIN OrderDetails ON OrderDetails.OrderID = Orders.OrderID
JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
JOIN Customers ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany" GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductId ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC LIMIT 1
